    p1: 'Hello, my name is Ines. I am a German-speaking junior front-end developer who grew up mainly in Austria and Kenya. I have loved technology since I got my hands on my first (very cheap used) computer, which I was able to bring to life with Linux.',
    p2:'I discovered programming mainly during my studies at university, which focused on chemistry. I soon realized that I enjoyed analyzing data much more than collecting data through experiments and standing in the lab, and I started solving programming problems for relaxation and fun. After realizing that I particularly liked the intersection of creativity and logic, I discovered my passion for web and software development. I wanted to do this professionally and develop real-life products.',
    p3:'I looked for a way to learn development professionally and came across the Developer Akademie. The approach of learning independently, while building real projects and getting code reviews from experienced developers, as well as having the opportunity to develop some projects in a team, gives me a perfect foundation to start my career as a junior front-end developer.',
